## Prerequisites
MuPIF requires the python interpreter, version 3.2 or newer. It has been tested on Linux / Windows systems. Network communication relies on Pyro4 module.

## Installation

There are two options for MuPIF installation:
* The first, recommended one, relies on Python Package Index (run as pip3 or pip) 
* For a system wide installation (needs admin privilegies): `pip3 install mupif`
* For a user space installation: `pip3 install mupif --user`

The second option relies on the most advanced version on github:
* ```git clone https://github.com/mupif/mupif.git mupif.git```*
