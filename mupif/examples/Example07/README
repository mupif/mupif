To run the example:
-------------------
> python Example07.py


If you have this error when you run the example:
> SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing

it comes from pyvtk package. You have to open the PolyData.py and Scalars.py source code files, and replace all split(' ') by split().

This error is explained in details here:
