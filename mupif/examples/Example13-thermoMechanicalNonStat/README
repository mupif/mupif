This example demonstrates a coupled thermo-mechanical analysis consisting of cantilever, clamped on the left hand side edge and subjected to nonstationary temperature loading. The top edges is subjected to heat convection, left and bottom edges have prescribed temperature and right edge is insulated. First, the temperature distribution has to be solved in the whole specimen from the given boundary conditions for each time step. Then the temperature filed is passed to mechanical analysis, which evaluates the corresponding deformations.

This example Demo13.local.py runs as a local version (non-distributed). It uses instances of demoapp module, allocated on the fly from the script. It can be extended to run on two servers, or using a JobManager, if needed.
