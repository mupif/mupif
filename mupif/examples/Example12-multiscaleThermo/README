This example demonstrates a multiscale approach for solving stationary heat transfer on a perforated ceramic sheet. Due to a periodic sheet structure, it is advantageous to separate two scales: 

1. Macroscale - the ceramic sheet has dimensions 400 x 200 mm and contains circular holes, see figure below. Heat transfer model simplifies such a heterogeneous morphology to a homogeneous continuum using an effective conductivity coming from a microscale.
2. Microscale - a representative volume element (RVE) captures morphology of ceramic sheet with a circular hole. RVE size is 2 x 2 mm. Effective conductivity of RVE is determined.

Microscale simulation considers RVE with a temperature gradient in x direction, assigning 0oC to the left edge and 1oC to the right edge. Solution of heat balance equation via finite elements provides temperature field on figure below. The RVE uses a regular structured mesh of 40 x 40 quadrilateral elements which yields 1599 equations for unknown temperature field. Heat conductivity is assigned as 1.0 W/m/K for solid elements. The effective conductivity is obtained by calculating heat flow on the right edge and from assigned boundary temperatures. The effective conductivity yields 0.314 W/m/K from the RVE and computation time is about 2.0 s. 

Effective conductivity from the microscale is passed to the macroscale. Macroscale has dimensions 400 x 200 mm and is discretized into 40 x 20 finite elements, yielding 840 equations for unknown temperature field. Solution time is about 1.0 s. Figure below shows discretization and the resulting temperature field.

This example Example12.py runs as a local version (non-distributed). It uses instances of demoapp module, allocated on the fly from the script. It can be extended to run on two servers (micro and macro), or using a JobManager, if needed.
